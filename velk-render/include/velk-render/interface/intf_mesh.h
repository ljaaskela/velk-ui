 * @brief Combined vertex + index storage for one or more IMeshPrimitives.
 *
 * Layout inside the buffer: VBO bytes at offset 0, followed immediately
 * by IBO bytes at offset `get_ibo_offset()` (== `get_vbo_size()`).
 * A single underlying VkBuffer is allocated with SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS
 * (for bindless VBO reads) and INDEX_BUFFER usage (so the IBO half can
 * be bound via vkCmdBindIndexBuffer at `get_ibo_offset()`).
 *
 * Primitives without an IBO (e.g. TriangleStrip unit quad) set
 * `ibo_size == 0`; the backend skips the index-bind and dispatches as
 * a non-indexed draw.
 *
 * A single IMeshBuffer may back many IMeshPrimitives (glTF's standard
 * layout: one buffer per mesh, each primitive carries a vertex/index
 * range into it). The MeshBuilder also shares buffers across fresh
 * IMesh instances for procedural primitives so repeated `get_cube(subs)`
 * calls reuse one GPU upload.
