 * Holds an ordered sequence of GPU ops + explicit read / write resource
 * declarations. The executor walks ops 1:1 to backend methods; the
 * graph's compile step inspects ops + reads/writes to classify the
 * pass's stage (raster / compute / blit) and insert a pipeline barrier
 * before consumers of prior writes.
 *
 * Bindless texture reads from materials are NOT declared — they're
 * invisible to the graph and stay fence-synced at the descriptor-set
 * level. Tier 1 tracks resources at coarse granularity: gbuffer
 * attachments are tracked through the group resource (not per-
 * attachment), and non-Ptr handles (raw `TextureId`,
 * `RenderTargetGroup`) are out of scope.

 * Tier 1 contract:
 *
 * - Identifies resources by `IGpuResource::Ptr` identity. The Ptr
 *   keeps the resource alive for the graph's lifetime.
 * - Pipelines / paths call `add_pass` to enqueue work. Insertion
 *   order is preserved (no topo reorder in Tier 1; the existing emit
 *   order is correct).
 * - `compile()` walks the pass list and inserts barriers based on a
 *   per-resource state machine.
 * - `execute(IRenderBackend&)` walks the compiled list and dispatches
 *   each pass to the backend, replacing the per-PassKind switch +
 *   `had_texture_pass` heuristic that lived in `Renderer::present()`.
 *
 * Owned per `FrameSlot` on the Renderer. `clear()`-ed at frame start.
 *
 * NOT in Tier 1: transient resource pool (Tier 2), pass culling /
 * merging (Tier 3), pass-Ptr caching (see design-notes/persistent_passes.md).
