/**
 * @brief Base interface for any object that owns one or more GPU handles.
 *
 * GPU resources require careful destruction: a handle being used by an
 * in-flight draw call must not be released until the GPU finishes with it.
 * This is solved by an observer pattern: the renderer (or any GPU-aware
 * subsystem) registers as an observer when it creates a GPU handle for the
 * resource. When the resource's last strong reference drops and its dtor
 * runs, observers are notified synchronously and can enqueue their handles
 * for deferred destruction.
 *
 * Concrete subtypes (`ITexture`, future `IBuffer`, etc.) inherit from this
 * interface and rely on a small mixin (`ext::GpuResourceMixin`) to manage
 * the observer list and notify in their dtor.
 *
 * Lifetime contract:
 * - The owner of a strong reference may drop it on any thread, at any time.
 * - The resource's dtor runs on whichever thread released last.
 * - Observers must do minimal, lock-protected work in their callbacks
 *   (e.g. push to a deferred-destruction queue).
 * - Observers must NOT outlive the resources they observe without first
 *   calling `remove_gpu_resource_observer()`. The simplest way to achieve
 *   this is for observers to either own the resource (renderer holds the
 *   only weak link) or detach during their own shutdown.
 *
 * Chain: IInterface -> IGpuResource
