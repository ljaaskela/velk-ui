/**
 * @brief A 2D image resource identified by URI, with a load lifecycle.
 *
 * `IImage` is the resource concept: an image known by URI, cached and
 * deduplicated by the resource store, optionally pinned via the persistence
 * flag inherited from `IResource`. It is intentionally minimal: dimensions
 * and format live on `ISurface`, pixel data on `IBuffer`.
 *
 * The concrete `Image` class produced by the image plugin's decoder
 * implements `IImage`, `ISurface`, and `IBuffer`. Apps holding an
 * `IImage::Ptr` can `interface_cast<ISurface>(image)` to get the binding
 * surface for materials.
 *
 * Sync v1 only ever produces `Loaded` or `Failed` status. `Unloaded` and
 * `Loading` exist in the enum so consumers can be written defensively for
 * future lazy and async loading without an interface change.
 *
 * Chain: IInterface -> IResource -> IImage
