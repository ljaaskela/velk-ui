| [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) | 4.x | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | Embedded in `velk_text.dll` |
| [Slug reference shaders](https://github.com/EricLengyel/Slug) | 2025 reference | MIT / Apache 2.0 (patent in public domain) | Translated to GLSL in `plugins/text/src/embedded/velk_text_glsl.h` |
| [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) | latest (single header) | MIT or Public Domain (dual) | `plugins/image/third_party/stb/stb_image.h` |

## Inter font

The Inter typeface by Rasmus Andersson is embedded as the default font in the text plugin (`velk_text`). The full SIL Open Font License is at [`plugins/text/third_party/inter/OFL.txt`](plugins/text/third_party/inter/OFL.txt).

## FreeType

FreeType is distributed under the FreeType License (FTL), a BSD-style license. The full license is included in the FreeType source archive.

## HarfBuzz

HarfBuzz is distributed under the MIT license. The full license is included in the HarfBuzz source archive.

## GLFW

GLFW is distributed under the Zlib license. The full license is included in the GLFW source archive.

## volk

volk is a meta-loader for Vulkan, distributed under the MIT license.

## VMA (Vulkan Memory Allocator)

VMA is distributed under the MIT license by AMD GPUOpen.

## shaderc

shaderc is Google's GLSL to SPIR-V compiler, distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Used as a shared library from the Vulkan SDK for runtime shader compilation.

## stb_image

`stb_image.h` is a single-header public domain (or MIT) image loader by Sean Barrett, vendored as `plugins/image/third_party/stb/stb_image.h`. Used by the image plugin (`velk_image`) to decode png/jpg/bmp/tga/gif/hdr/psd images into RGBA8 pixel data. The full dual license text is at the bottom of the header file itself.

## Slug reference shaders

The text plugin (`velk_text`) uses analytic Bezier glyph coverage adapted from Eric Lengyel's [Slug](https://github.com/EricLengyel/Slug) reference shaders, published under a dual license (MIT, Apache 2.0). The Slug patent was [placed into the public domain](https://terathon.com/blog/decade-slug.html) in March 2026. Velk-platform has **translated the pixel-shader algorithm to GLSL** and adapted it from Lengyel's curve+band texture layout to velk-platform `std430` buffer-reference layout. The translated shader lives in `plugins/text/src/embedded/velk_text_glsl.h` and is documented as derived work from Lengyel's reference. The CPU-side glyph baker, band assignment, GPU buffer management, and material/visual integration are original code.
