# Mesh

Velk models 3D geometry in two layers, matching glTF 2.0 vocabulary exactly.

- `IMesh` inteface defines a container: an authored group of primitives with an aggregate bounding box. Carries no geometry or material directly.
- `IMeshPrimitive` defines one geometry + material unit (what glTF calls a "primitive", what Unity/Unreal call a "submesh"). Owns the vertex/index range, attribute layout, topology, bounds, and a material `ObjectRef`.
- `IMeshBuffer` defines the GPU-resident VBO + IBO storage. A single `IMeshBuffer` may back many primitives in the same mesh (glTF's standard layout) or be exclusive to one.

A multi-material model (e.g. a car body with paint, glass, trim) is one `IMesh` with multiple primitives, each carrying its own material. Per-primitive is the granularity renderers care about because a draw call binds one pipeline + one material.

## Buffers

`IMeshBuffer` holds VBO bytes followed by IBO bytes in one allocation (VBO at offset 0, IBO at `get_ibo_offset()`). A primitive without indices reports `get_ibo_size() == 0`; the backend skips the index bind and dispatches a non-indexed draw.

Two sibling primitives in the same mesh may return the same `IMeshBuffer::Ptr` from `get_buffer()`. Each primitive's `get_vertex_offset()` / `get_vertex_count()` / `get_index_offset()` / `get_index_count()` describe its range into the shared buffer. Callers key batching by buffer pointer and offsets, and the backend issues the right offset arguments to `vkCmdBindIndexBuffer` / the vertex-pulling shader.

## Building meshes

Meshes and primitives are authored artifacts. Construction goes through `IMeshBuilder`, owned by the `IRenderContext`:

```cpp
// Low-level: one primitive with its own exclusive buffer.
auto primitive = ctx.get_mesh_builder().build_primitive(
    attributes, vertex_stride,
    vertex_data, vertex_count,
    index_data, index_count,
    topology,
    bounds);

// Container wrapping one or more primitives.
IMeshPrimitive::Ptr prims[] = { primitive };
auto mesh = ctx.get_mesh_builder().build({ prims, 1 });

// Convenience: single-primitive mesh in one call.
auto mesh = ctx.get_mesh_builder().build(
    attributes, vertex_stride, vertex_data, vertex_count,
    index_data, index_count, topology, bounds);
```

For glTF import with shared buffers across primitives, allocate the `IMeshBuffer` directly, then construct each primitive referencing it with its own offsets and counts.

## Procedural primitives

`IMeshBuilder` also provides cached procedural shapes:

```cpp
auto cube = ctx.get_mesh_builder().get_cube(/*subdivisions=*/0);
auto sphere = ctx.get_mesh_builder().get_sphere(/*subdivisions=*/16);
```

Each call produces a fresh `IMesh` + fresh `IMeshPrimitive` so per-instance materials are independent. The underlying `IMeshBuffer` is cached by (shape, subdivisions), so repeated calls upload the GPU bytes exactly once.

The `RenderContext` API wrapper exposes shortcuts:

```cpp
auto ctx = app.render_context();
auto cube_mesh = ctx.build_cube();
auto sphere_mesh = ctx.build_sphere(32);
```

`get_unit_quad()` returns a shared singleton `IMesh` used by every 2D visual as its implicit geometry; its primitive carries no material and never will.

## Authoring materials on primitives

Materials are a property of the primitive, not the mesh. Using the `velk::ui::Mesh` API wrapper:

```cpp
velk::ui::Mesh cube_mesh(ctx.build_cube());
cube_mesh.set_material(0, velk::material::create_standard(
    velk::color{0.95f, 0.7f, 0.4f, 1.f}, /*metallic=*/0.9f, /*roughness=*/0.15f));
```

`set_material(idx, mat)` is sugar for `mesh.primitive(idx).set_material(mat)`. Each primitive's material is independent; setting material on primitive 0 never affects primitive 1.

To attach the mesh to a 3D visual:

```cpp
auto cube_vis = velk::ui::trait::visual::create_cube();
cube_vis.set_mesh(cube_mesh);
cube.add_trait(cube_vis);
```

See [materials](materials.md) for how material pipelines compile and how per-primitive material flows into draw calls.

## Bounds

`IMesh::get_bounds()` returns the aggregate AABB spanning every primitive. It is computed lazily as the union of primitive bounds on first call and cached. Procedural shapes pre-populate the aggregate at construction because the extent is known analytically; callers never observe the lazy path for those. A mesh mutated after construction (not yet a supported case) would invalidate the cache.

Each primitive reports its own local-space bounds via `IMeshPrimitive::get_bounds()`. Importers should supply this from glTF's per-primitive `min`/`max` accessor fields directly.

## Relationship to Visual3D

3D visuals reference a mesh through `IVisual3D::mesh` (an `ObjectRef`). Procedural primitives like `CubeVisual` and `SphereVisual` lazily populate this slot on first render using the mesh builder when the caller hasn't set one explicitly. Once populated, the visual's mesh is observable via `Visual3D::get_mesh()` and its primitives' materials can be set per-instance.

Callers who want to configure material at authoring time (before the first frame) build the mesh up-front through the context:

```cpp
auto mesh = ctx.build_cube();
velk::ui::Mesh(mesh).set_material(0, my_material);
cube_vis.set_mesh(mesh);
```

See [traits](../ui/traits.md) for the Visual2D / Visual3D split and how visuals hook into the element system.
